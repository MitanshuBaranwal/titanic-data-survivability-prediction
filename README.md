- Required Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, sklearn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MitanshuBaranwal/titanic_data_survivability_prediction.git

   cd titanic_data_survivability_prediction/

## ModelBuilding 

Open file "build_model" and run the file it will save the model logistic_regression_model.pkl file. 

Alternatively you can directly use use_model file as well as saved model is already present in the folder.

You can do the prediction for custom data sets of yours in use_model script by providing the data set that you want to predict
